<Features/>

Gravity is a SwiftUI library for remote data fetching. I acts as a Network Layer for your SwiftUI app, providing a simple and declarative way to fetch data from the server. It uses `stale-while-revalidate` technonology to fetch data from the server, a cache invalidation strategy popularized by [HTTP RFC 5861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861).
Gravity first returns the data from cache (stale), then sends the fetch request (revalidate), and finally comes with the up-to-date data again.

  With Gravity, components will get a stream of data updates <strong>constantly</strong> and <strong>automatically</strong>.
  And the UI will be always <strong>fast</strong> and <strong>reactive</strong>.

## Overview

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Gravity

struct LandmarkList: View {
    @RemoteObjects<LandmarkBase>(request: .all) var landmarks
    var body: some View {
        List(landmarks, id: \.id) { landmark in
            LandmarkRow(landmark: landmark)
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the property wrapper `@RemoteObjects` accepts a `request` and returns an array of all the `Landmark`.

`LandmarkBase` acts as a controller for the `Landmark` model. It is responsible for fetching the data from the server and returning it to Gravity. The rest is handled by Gravity.
