# Installation

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

It is the recommended way to install Gravity.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Gravity as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/pr1mer-tech/Gravity.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.1.0"))
]
```
