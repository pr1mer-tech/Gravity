# 2. Define the controller
In order to pull and push the data from the database, we need to define the controller. The controller is the place where we define the logic of the application.

```swift
import Gravity

final class LandmarkBase: RemoteObjectDelegate {
    typealias Element = Landmark // Tells the RemoteObjectDelegate which type of object it is working with

    var store = try! Store<LandmarkBase>(reference: "landmarks") // Defines the store where the data will be stored and cached

    func pull(request: RemoteRequest<Landmark>) async throws -> [Landmark] {
        // Fetches the data from the database
    }
    
    func push(elements: [Landmark]) async throws {
        // Pushes the data to the database
    }
    
    static var shared = LandmarkBase() // Defines the shared instance of the controller
}
```

    The `RemoteObjectDelegate` protocol also supports other methods, and you can find more information about them in the <Link href="/docs/remote-object-delegate">RemoteObjectDelegate</Link> page.
