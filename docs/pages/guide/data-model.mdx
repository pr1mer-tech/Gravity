# 1. Define your model

For normal RESTful APIs with JSON data, first you need to create a model structure, which represents the expected result:

```swift
import Gravity

struct Landmark: RemoteRepresentable {
    var id: Int
    var name: String
    var park: String
    var state: String
    var description: String
}
```

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
    The `RemoteRepresentable` protocol is a special protocol that makes it possible to cache the data in the local storage. It automatically conforms to the `Codable`, `Hashable`, `Identifiable` protocols, so you don't need to implement them manually.
